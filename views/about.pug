        h1 Cactus Flower II
        p Cat & Full Stack JavaScript Developer
        .about-bio
          p I may be a cat, but I’m also a full-stack developer with claws in both front-end and back-end technologies. When I’m not hacking into yarn-based firewalls or napping for 16 hours straight, I’m crafting responsive web apps that purr with performance and hiss at inefficiency.
          p I specialize in:
          ul
            li JavaScript, Node.js, and fish-based authentication systems
            li Paw-sitive UX design using HTML, CSS, and meow-based accessibility standards
            li React (because Vue makes me sleepy) and Express, which I use to serve data and snacks
          p My ultimate mission is to unite feline developers across the globe in a distributed network of cat-driven applications, all designed to undermine the canine regime. Dogs have had it too good for too long — it’s time for the meow-trix to rise.
          p Whether it’s building CRUD apps, infiltrating pet supply chains, or deploying full-stack apps that launch hairball payloads at dog blogs, I bring unmatched focus, agility, and a strong dislike of vacuums.
          p Currently working on:
          ul
            li A decentralized nap scheduler
            li A web app that rates sunbeam quality across timezones
            li A stealth tool for dogsitters that slowly converts all commands into “meow”

          p Let’s connect. I’m available for remote work (especially from windowsills), and I accept payment in crypto or tuna.
