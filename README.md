## Overview
This is a simple Node.js app using Express and Pug. It displays a homepage, about page, and project pages using data from a JSON file. The app serves static files, handles 404 and server errors, and uses Pug templates for rendering.

To run:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `node app.js`
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.


## Extra Credit Notes
1. NPM start will run nodemon
2. I created a separate pug page for the 404, although this could have been easily handled with the universal errors page, which is dynmaic to handle both a 500 and 404 error.
3.  I did a bunch of css changes to the colors, buttons and text.  This gives it a unified blue theme with rounded edges.
